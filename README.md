# MLCanopyCore

A multi-layered vegetation canopy physics engine

This is a stand-alone version, aka just the "core", of Gordon Bonan's [CLM-ml_v1](https://github.com/gbonan/CLM-ml_v1/tree/main) model. Whereas the original model contains a mixture of new data-structures and methods specific to multi-layer canopy physics, it also enmeshed many of those routines with CLM specific support code. In this version, that support code is separated out and sent to live in the CTSM repository.
