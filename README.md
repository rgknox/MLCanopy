# MLCanopy
A multi-layered vegetation canopy physics engine

This is a stand-alone version of Gordon Bonan's [CLM-ml_v1](https://github.com/gbonan/CLM-ml_v1/tree/main) model. Whereas the original model contains a mixture of new stand-alone datastructures specific to multi-layer canopy physics, it also enmeshed many of those routines with CLM specific support code. In this version, that support code is intended to live in the CTSM repository.
